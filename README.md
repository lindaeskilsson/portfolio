👋 Hi, I’m Linda Eskilsson

I’m a Java developer in training with a background in front-end development and UX.
This GitHub portfolio showcases projects where I apply clean Java code, database design, and structured problem-solving.

My focus is on building understandable, maintainable solutions rather than over-engineering.

🧠 What I work with

Java (OOP, collections, streams, testing basics)

Databases: SQL (MySQL), normalization, relations

JPA / Hibernate

Backend fundamentals (CLI apps, data handling, persistence)

Frontend & UX: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

Tools: Git, GitHub, Maven, Docker, IntelliJ IDEA

📂 Portfolio projects

One-to-Many & Many-to-Many relations

ORM with JPA/Hibernate

Database configuration and persistence

Structured Git workflow

🗄️ Database & SQL Labs

A collection of exercises and labs covering:

SQL queries (JOIN, GROUP BY, constraints)

Database design & normalization

🎯 How I think as a developer

I value clarity over cleverness

I prefer simple, readable solutions

I work step-by-step and validate my assumptions

I enjoy structuring code, data, and workflows

I’m comfortable switching between frontend, backend, and database thinking

🔍 What I’m looking for

I’m aiming for a role where I can:

Work with Java and backend development

Grow toward full-stack over time

Be part of a team that values structure, quality, and learning
